# biocolabs

A collection of colabs useful for molecular biology tasks.
See this [booleanbiotech blogpost](http://blog.booleanbiotech.com/colab-computational-drug-design-2023.html)
for more details.

## DiffDock
This colab allows you to dock a ligand to a protein with DiffDock, refines the docked position with gnina,
displays the result in the notebook, and downloads all the outputs.

## MD_protein_ligand
This colab allows you to run a simple MD simulation of a protein and a ligand,
displays the result in the notebook, and downloads all the outputs.
The code is from https://github.com/hgbrian/MD_protein_ligand

## SMILES_to_properties
This colab takes as input a SMILES and returns predicted properties, using [chemprop](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop).

## pdb2png
A simple colab that turns a PDB file into a high-quality PNG using pymol.

## Pocket2Mol
A basic colab for running [Pocket2Mol](https://github.com/pengxingang/Pocket2Mol).
